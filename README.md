#  Airline Customer Booking Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In todayâ€™s competitive travel industry, customers often make their booking decisions long before reaching the airport. Airlines need to **proactively identify potential buyers** rather than reactively targeting them at the point of departure.  
This project builds a **predictive machine learning model** to forecast whether a customer will purchase a holiday, based on their booking behavior and profile data.

The pipeline includes:
- Data exploration and statistical analysis
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Model training using a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Model evaluation with cross-validation and performance metrics
- Feature importance visualization to interpret predictive power

## âœ¨ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw booking data for modeling
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new predictors to enhance model accuracy
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses a Random Forest algorithm for classification
- **Model Evaluation**: Reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Interpretability**: Visualizes how each variable influences predictions
